                A unicorn is a legendary and mythical creature. It looks like a pony with one long, single and white horn on
                its head. The word unicorn means literally "one-horn". It comes from the Latin word ūnus, which means one,
                and cornu which means horn, which term is in itself borrowed from the earlier Greek word monokerōs (also
                'one horned').
